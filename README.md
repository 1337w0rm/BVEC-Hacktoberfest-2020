# How to create a Pull Request

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nisnym/first-contributions/master/assets/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the clone button and then click the *copy to clipboard* icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```
where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://github.com/nisnym/first-contributions/raw/master/assets/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:
```
git clone https://github.com/<Your Username here>/BVEC-Hacktoberfest-2020.git
```
Replace <Your username here>  with your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the BVEC-Hacktoberfest-2020 repository from GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd BVEC-Hacktoberfest-2020
```
Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:
```
git checkout -b <add-your-new-branch-name>
```

For example:
```
git checkout -b Aditya
```
(The name of the branch does not need to have the word *add* in it, but it's a reasonable thing to include because the purpose of this branch is to add your name to a list.)

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the git add command:
```markdown
git add .
```

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```
git commit -m "Your custom Message"
```

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:
```
git push origin <add-your-branch-name>
```
replacing `<add-your-branch-name>` with the name of the branch you created earlier in my case it's `Aditya` so the command will be 
`git push origin aditya`.

* Now goto Github website and open your forked repo. You'll se a `Create a new pull request` buttton. Click on it and follow the instructions to complete your pull request.
* Wait for your PR review and merge approval!

## First PR/Pull Request)

Your first pull request will be your Name, Branch and Semester to the `name.txt` file.

## Second PR/Pull Request

You will have to write a program using loops and if else statement with the language of your choice and push it to this repository.


## Third PR/Pull Request

Write one more program with the language of your choice but this time add comments. Make sure to use loops and if else statement.

## Fourth PR/Pull Request

Try to do this on your own on some other public repository

Go through the issue tabs for some other repository and try to find issues labelled as `good first issues` or `hactoberfest`. If possible try to solve them and create your fourth PR/Pull Request.
